This Learning was developed as a key deliverable for the C++ Programming module during the CDAC Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing (PG-DAC) course. It demonstrates proficiency in applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to build a functional, console-based application.

ðŸ”‘ C++ & Core Concepts Implemented
This project effectively utilizes several key C++ concepts learned during the CDAC curriculum:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Classes & Objects: Implementation of core entities like Student, Course, and Attendance as distinct classes with proper Encapsulation.

Inheritance & Polymorphism: [If used, e.g., A base class Person is inherited by Student and Faculty, using virtual functions for the display_details() method.]

Constructors & Destructors: Demonstrating proper resource management and the Rule of Three/Five (if dynamic memory is managed).

Data Structures (Optional):

Use of Standard Template Library (STL) containers like std::vector or std::map for efficient data storage and retrieval.

[If applicable, e.g., Custom implementation of a Singly Linked List to maintain student records.]

File Handling:

Persistent Storage: Using fstream for reading and writing data to files ([Specify: text files (.txt) or binary files (.dat)]) to ensure data is preserved across sessions.
