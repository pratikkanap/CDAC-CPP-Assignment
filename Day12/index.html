    <h1>Maclren</h1>
<p>The McLaren F1 is a sports car that was the first type approved road-going sportscar manufactured by British Formula One team McLaren.[5] It was the last road-legal, series-produced sportscar to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans race outright,[6] as well as being recognised as the world's fastest 'production car' when launched. The original concept, by leading technical designer Gordon Murray, convinced then head of McLaren Ron Dennis, to support McLaren leaping into manufacturing road-going sportscars. Car designer Peter Stevens was hired to do the car's exterior and interior styling.

To manufacture the F1, McLaren Cars (now McLaren Automotive) was set up; and BMW was contracted to develop and make BMW S70/2 V12 engines, specifically and exclusively limited for use in the F1. The car had numerous proprietary designs and technologies. As one of the first sportscars with a fully carbon-fibre monocoque body and chassis structure, it is both lighter and more streamlined than many later competitors, despite the F1 having seats for three adults. An unconventional seating layout, with the driver's seat front and centre, and two passenger seats (on the driver's left and right), gives the driver improved visibility. Murray conceived the F1 as an exercise in creating 'the ultimate road-going sportscar', in the spirit of Bruce McLaren's original plans for the M6 GT.

Production began in 1992 and ended in 1998; in all, 106 cars were manufactured, with some variations in the design.[7] Although not originally designed as a race car, modified racing versions of the car won several races, including the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans.

On 31 March 1998, the XP5 prototype with a modified rev limiter set the Guinness World Record for the world's fastest production car, reaching 240.1 mph (386.4 km/h),[8] surpassing the Jaguar XJ220's 217.1 mph (349.4 km/h) record from 1992 achieved with an increased rev limit and catalytic converters removed.
